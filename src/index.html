                COPY:Proof-of-space (PoSpace), also called proof-of-capacity (PoC), is a means of showing that one has a legitimate interest in a service (such as sending an email) by allocating a non-trivial amount of memory or disk space to solve a challenge presented by the service provider.

                COPY:This calculator takes the current network difficulty, and calculates expected Chia mined with whatever hard drive space you allocate. This is a long-term average...months/years. This only uses probability to calculate. You will have good days and bad days mining, and this shows the average. This doesn't take into account the difficulty of mining increasing over time...it only uses the difficulty of mining at this moment in time.

                COPY:Proof of space are very similar to proof of work, except that instead of computation, storage is used. Proof-of-space is related to, but also considerably different from, memory-hard functions and proofs of retrievability.

                COPY:A proof-of-space is a piece of data that a prover sends to a verifier to prove that the prover has reserved a certain amount of space. For practicality, the verification process needs to be efficient, namely, consumes a small amount of space and time. For soundness, it should be hard for the prover to pass the verification if it does not actually reserve the claimed amount of space. One way of implementing PoSpace is by using hard-to-pebble graphs.[1] [3] The verifier asks the prover to build a labeling of a hard-to-pebble graph. The prover commits to the labeling. The verifier then asks the prover to open several random locations in the commitment.
