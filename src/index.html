                    This calculator takes the current network difficulty, and calculates expected Burst mined with whatever hard drive space you allocate. This is a long-term average...months/years. This only uses probability to calculate. You will have good days and bad days mining, and this shows the average. This doesn't take into account the difficulty of mining increasing over time...it only uses the difficulty of mining at this moment in time.
